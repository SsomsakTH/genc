# Generative Computing (GenC)

**Generative Computing** (GenC) is an open-source framework and an initiative
to facilitate building GenAI-powered applications in a composable manner, by
integrating diverse components across platforms and ecosystems and bringing them
together for use by application developers.

GenC is designed for customizability, portability, and composability in several
dimensions: for deployments across on-device, on-prem, and cloud (including
hybrid device plus cloud) and across platforms and programming languages (e.g.,
Python, C++, and Java), from prototyping to production deployment, and across
different frontend SDKs and service backends.

For more information, see the following:

*   [Tutorials](generative_computing/docs/tutorials/README.md) show diverse
    examples of usage to showcase some of GenC's capabilities.

*   [API documentation](generative_computing/docs/api.md) cover the developer
    and extensibility surfaces.

*   [Model documentation](generative_computing/docs/models.md) lists the
    supported models.

*   [Architecture](generative_computing/docs/architecture.md),
    [IR](generative_computing/docs/ir.md), and
    [runtime](generative_computing/docs/runtime.md) cover more advanced topics
    for a deeper level of customization.

*   [Setup](SETUP.md) instructions explain how to setup a full development
    and runtime environment that you can use to build GenC, run and customize
    the included examples (at this time, we only support building from source
    in GitHub; additional support for things like PIP releases, pre-built
    images, etc., will be included in the future).

*   [Contributors](CONTRIBUTING.md) instructions explain where and how you can
    contribute to the platform. GenC is designed to be extensible, and we'd
    like to grow it, with your help, to support your preferred domain and the
    kinds of services and capabilities you need. We welcome your contributions!
