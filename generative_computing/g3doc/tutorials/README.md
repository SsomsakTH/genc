*   [Simple chain in LangChain powered by a device-to-Cloud cascade]
    (tutotial_1_simple_cascade.ipynb).
    This tutorial shows how to define simple application logic in LangChain,
    use our interop APIs to configure it to be powered by a cascade of models
    that spans across a model in Cloud and an on-device model on Android,
    and deploy it in a Java app on an Android phone. This illustrates many of
    the key interoperability and portability benefits of GenC in one concise
    package. See the follow-up tutorials listed below for how you can further
    extend and customize such logic to power more complex use cases.

    and one other alternative tool)

    own custom functions, alternative inference backends, add new operators to
    the system, etc.)
