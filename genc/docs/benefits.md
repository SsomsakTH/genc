# Benefits offered by GenC

Summary of the benefits offered by GenC:

*   Composability & flexibility:

    *   Ability to freely compose building blocks to express your own
        application logic.
    *   Ability to integrate diverse SDKs, platforms, and ecosystems
        (e.g., LangChain, mobile platforms, cloud services, databases, models,
        etc.).
    *   Ability to express processing that combines on-device/on-prem and
        cloud components.

*   Portability & platform independence:

    *   Across programming languages (e.g., from Python to Java and C++).
    *   Across prototyping and production deployments (e.g., from Colab
        notebooks, to cloud servers, to mobile apps).
    *   Across different mobile and cloud platforms.
    *   Can be configured with minimal dependencies for lightweight deployments
        (e.g, on embedded/IoT and other specialized platforms).

*   Customizability:

    *   Ability to incorporate your own libraries and network services (models,
        databases, etc.) as GenC building blocks, and mix and match them with
        those that already exist.
    *   Ability to create your own custom runtimes.

*   Development velocity:

    *   Building blocks allow logic to be expressed succinctly, at high level,
        and easily modified.
    *   Portability enables prototype code to be deployed with minimal effort
        to production environments.

*   Performance & security:

    *   C++ runtime (faster, more secure than Python).
    *   Asynchronous and parallel functional programming model.
    *   Application logic, represented in a declarative form, can be statically
        analyzed, verified, optimized, and executed on scalable distributed
        platforms.
